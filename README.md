## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.79.0", require: false
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB â€” feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code â€” and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!

- Filters
